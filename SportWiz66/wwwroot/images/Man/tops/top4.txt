adidas Navy Tiro 21 Track Top

You can't train for real life. But you can look good while you live it. This adidas Tiro 21 Training Top was born from football culture. Made from recycled materials, it features moisture-absorbing AEROREADY to keep you dry and confident. The stand-up collar and cuff thumbholes add on-demand coverage. It fits slim for when you need to move. This product is made with Primegreen, a series of high-performance recycled materials.
100% Recycled polyester.
