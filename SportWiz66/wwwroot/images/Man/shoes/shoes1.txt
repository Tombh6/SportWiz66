Nike Air Max VGR Trainers

Time happensâ€”keep up in your Nike Air Max VG-R, a new gesture of speed and air that lets you occupy the now. Inspired by the Air Max 95, the new design quickens the shape with hybrid lines evoking GT race cars and the driver's fast-paced breathing. Monofilament mesh on the upper adds rich texture and ventilation while Air cushioning in the heel softens the ride. Winning is just too easy when the shoes are an extension of your body.
